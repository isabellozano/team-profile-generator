# team-profile-generator
This is supposed to be fully functional software engineering team generator command line application.
The application is supposed to prompt user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members.
The user would be able to input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns.
When the user has completed building a team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
In order for this to be functional, I have to use the inquirer npm package to prompt the user for their email, id, and specific information based on their role with the company.
